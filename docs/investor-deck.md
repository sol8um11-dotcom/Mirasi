### Every Face Tells a Legend
**AI-Powered Indian Art Portraits | Seed Pitch**

---

## THE HOOK

What if you could see yourself painted by the masters of Tanjore, Madhubani, or Rajasthani miniature art — in 30 seconds, for Rs 49?

**Mirasi** transforms selfies into authentic Indian art portraits using AI trained on centuries-old art traditions. We're building the Lensa/Prisma of India — but for a market that has zero competition and 10x cultural resonance.

---

## THE PROBLEM

**1.4 billion people. Zero products celebrating their art heritage through AI.**

- Global AI portrait apps (Lensa, Prisma, Dawn AI) generate Western/anime styles
- Indian consumers spend Rs 2,000-15,000 on hand-painted portraits (2-4 week wait)
- 32M Indian pet-owning households — the fastest-growing segment — have no pet portrait options in Indian art styles
- India's digital art market is exploding but underserved by AI tools

The world's largest democracy and oldest continuous art traditions have been completely ignored by the AI portrait revolution.

---

## THE TIMING

### Why NOW is the inflection point:

**1. AI Model Breakthrough (2025-26)**
Black Forest Labs' Flux Kontext Pro — the first model that can reliably preserve a person's face identity while transforming the artistic style. Previous models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) couldn't do this. We tested 6+ models. Only Kontext works.

**2. India's UPI Moment**
12.7B monthly UPI transactions. Rs 49 impulse purchases are frictionless. No credit card needed. One QR scan = paid.

**3. Cultural Pride Wave**
From "Make in India" to Chandrayaan to RRR's global success — Indian consumers are actively seeking products that celebrate their heritage. This isn't nostalgia; it's identity.

**4. Pet Economy Explosion**
India's pet market: $3.6B (2024) → projected $9.1B by 2028. Pet parents are the highest-spending, most shareable demographic.

## THE VISION

Mirasi starts with portraits. But every Indian has a wall, a WhatsApp DP, and an Instagram grid.

We're building the platform where India's ancient art traditions meet AI — making centuries-old artistic heritage accessible to 1.4 billion people, one selfie at a time.

**Every face tells a legend. We help you find yours.**
